<<< 26 September 2017 at 09:58:52 BST: Hello
>>> 26 September 2017 at 09:59:08 BST: Hei sweetheart
>>> 26 September 2017 at 09:59:19 BST: Do you need VPN?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 09:59:21 BST: ☺️😊
<<< 26 September 2017 at 09:59:26 BST: I am using VPN
<<< 26 September 2017 at 09:59:54 BST: Because when I want to log in it seems not working without VPN
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:00:02 BST: But we can use this
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:00:06 BST: For txting
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:00:14 BST: It is save?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:00:32 BST: More than other chatting app?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:03:38 BST: Yes. It is the most secure
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:03:54 BST: But it's a pity it doesn't work without VPN
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:04:30 BST: Does it allow phone calls?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:04:36 BST: Pity, but at least we can have any conversation we want
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:05:15 BST: Image (6b82fa3dada575e8.jpg)
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:06:09 BST: Seems not
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:07:15 BST: Maybe it's because I am using the work version
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:07:29 BST: I bought the work version for PL
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:07:40 BST: Maybe I haven't verified my number?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:07:41 BST: But I can buy the normal one as well
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:07:50 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:07:54 BST: I think the fault is on my side
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:07:59 BST: Ok
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:08:13 BST: You still haven't answered my question ...
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:08:20 BST: What?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:08:30 BST: My opinions on this?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:08:34 BST: Yes
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:10:57 BST: I think it is definitely good to have some privacy. As we cannot get privacy through wechat for sure, it is good we can use this. I think as long as we can talk freely, it is good. Maybe I still don't feel much a burden yet talking via wechat, so I don't feel too threatened
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:12:04 BST: But I know that wechat can be spied or monitored easily. Just a matter of whether they are going to track us and eventually control our day to day life
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:19:51 BST: Well, if they are planning to use all your internet data to give you a public score
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:20:07 BST: Then everything we say now, because is tracked and saved, could potentially be used later
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:20:31 BST: So you are right that maybe they don't really bother reading our chat, but they for sure are saving all of it
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:20:40 BST: And could use it against your layer
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:20:43 BST: Later
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:21:00 BST: Perpahs to deny you a certain job or a certain license you will need
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:28:07 BST: I think wechat is definitely convenient so far because most of the Chinese contacts are there, is that possible to let everyone of them to use this? Maybe in the future, but maybe it is too late when they realise. For sure if we are going to have some ideas of business and some of them are related with rules, this security concerns are very necessary.this actually let me think a lot. If we are so used to be in a system of exposure, what it can be? But people are quite blind of the situations of government controlling, or why they don't care?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:30:48 BST: I think you use this app for pigeonline because of business secrets within, but will you think of using this if you don't have projects but purely for personal communication? How is this privacy monitoring in western?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:09 BST: I think I can use without VPN
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:45:17 BST: Fantastic !
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:17 BST: But not for log in
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:28 BST: 😁
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:45:32 BST: But how often do you need to log in?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:41 BST: Not so far
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:45:53 BST: Oh so only once in a while
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:54 BST: I think unless I log off
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:45:58 BST: Yes
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:46:07 BST: Good. We are protected for a little while
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:46:27 BST: We can chat here and use WeChat or maybe skype for video chat and calls
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:46:33 BST: Yes
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:46:36 BST: That's good
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:46:39 BST: And beware of what we talk over there
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:46:46 BST: Ok
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:47:00 BST: You are right. I started using these more secure chats for business
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:47:19 BST: But once I read the latest news of the Chinese government I got more concerned for you
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:47:45 BST: I mean, before I was thinking they were reading my bullshit and watching my dick so I did not care much
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:47:46 BST: I know, it's scary
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:47:53 BST: But if this is going to influence your life
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:47:54 BST: Hahahahhaha
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:48:08 BST: Weather you can get a job or be allowed to flight overseas
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:48:14 BST: My tete too they might see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:48:26 BST: Then I think we need to be careful also about personal communication
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:48:34 BST: This app is very good. Fully encrypted
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:48:44 BST: That's good.
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:48:49 BST: Plus, is a small and paid one so maybe it will take a while before they notice
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:48:53 BST: Don't talk much about it
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:49:04 BST: we can send each other "secured news"
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:49:42 BST: Seems China is banning VPN also
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:49:47 BST: I know western news are biased
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:49:52 BST: So controlling
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:50:08 BST: I know, but at least I am free to know how they think
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:50:12 BST: What is your feeling from inside the country?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:51:14 BST: Funnily, I just saw a video of Jack ma, talking about he is somehow supporting to build up a credit or trust system
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:51:39 BST: He said he build up alibaba based on this principle
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:52:10 BST: And also he is cooperating a lot with government, and our government support a lot his business
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:53:09 BST: So I think people haven't yet aware what will be the results of this getting extreme
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:54:37 BST: Also I have also bias about the news you sent me. Because it seems like this for every countries, whether they can buy a house or getting a loan. I don't know yet how extreme it will get here though
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:55:52 BST: Credit cards are first rising from the west, and somehow they abuse it and cause the 2008 financial bubble.
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:56:50 BST: Yeah. Credit ratings systems can be quite dangerous
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:57:25 BST: But in the West if you are against the government it does not affect your credit score
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:57:26 BST: Because people can manipulate it
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:57:34 BST: Do you think this could happen in China?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:57:42 BST: Or is it happening?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:58:37 BST: Definitely not something against government. Anything might cause this will be educated. But this is like this even out of this system
<<< 26 September 2017 at 10:59:03 BST: Maybe it is easier and more convenient for them to access our "violation"
>>> 26 September 2017 at 10:59:25 BST: What do you mean? I am not following
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:00:03 BST: I mean even not within this rating system, long ago, it is kinda forbidden to do anything against government
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:02:24 BST: Okay. So it's easy to use it for downgrading rating system if they want
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:02:41 BST: They also talk about permission to fly overseas
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:03:00 BST: If you have a low score you could potentially get permission denied
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:05:27 BST: But it can be highly related to the growth of economic? No? I think they will set up a certain kind of rules, I mean otherwise what is the boundary of cut your rates? I think  most of Chinese citizens have more or less talked something behind the government
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:07:11 BST: Yeah, I could not read the full article ...
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:07:23 BST: But I see these years there are many decisions have been made by government to control this and that. Some of them will cause the economy loss of the local economy, and they stoped immediately.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:08:14 BST: But I pro your concerns
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:08:47 BST: It is always better to mind the privacy especially we don't know the situation yet
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:25:39 BST: How was your interview?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:26:28 BST: haha，it's quite funny actually, so there are two parts, the interviews and the exam
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:26:50 BST: So during the interview, in the end I was talking about my dream of building this platform
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:27:08 BST: I think they are quite shocked
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:27:09 BST: Wow
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:27:16 BST: Of course
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:27:22 BST: 😂😂😂
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:27:25 BST: How did it happen that your talk about that?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:27:34 BST: Isn't a bit extreme?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:27:37 BST: I told them I want to work for the poor
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:28:07 BST: And how to do useful things within financial system to practice this
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:28:39 BST: They ask me why I prefer to work in finance and switch to data analysis
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:28:58 BST: They just kept asking
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:30:08 BST: But it gives me a lot of motivation, don't know why
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:32:00 BST: Oh
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:32:06 BST: So you were honest
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:32:15 BST: What was their reaction?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:32:16 BST: Maybe too honest
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:32:31 BST: I think they want to laugh
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:32:44 BST: But they don't want to show it to me
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:33:02 BST: Anyway, I like this experience
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:33:14 BST: I am very confident
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:33:30 BST: Maybe next time I need to be calmer
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:36:42 BST: Wow
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:36:50 BST: Must have been an intense experience
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:36:56 BST: So I guess no offer from this job
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:37:08 BST: Did you understand why the pay is so high?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:37:27 BST: Haven't received any yet
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:37:44 BST: They said they will inform me later
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:38:05 BST: Because they need to evaluate the exam also
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:38:09 BST: Who knows
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:39:05 BST: They pay more because I think they are newly established branch under the government news agent, they are ambitious and rich
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:42:15 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:42:32 BST: What do you think about them? What do you think about the job? Ambitious about what?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:44:02 BST: Oh, I see there slogan, they want" 全世界听到他们的声音”， and they want to be chinese Bloomberg.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 11:45:38 BST: But the atmosphere is quite depressing, no one is talking or at least from my observations, they are not interested of team work or each other
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:58:10 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 11:58:21 BST: So will you be willing to work for them?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:03:58 BST: no
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:04:09 BST: Why?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:04:29 BST: seems they are not interested in innovation
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:05:25 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:06:08 BST: So you think they find your ideas ridiculous ... ?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:09:39 BST: I think they have no financial knowledge
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:09:56 BST: They are purely doing data analysis
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:14:03 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:14:16 BST: But why they want to laugh?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:14:23 BST: How does that make you feel?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:15:45 BST: Maybe they think I am too idealistic and they cannot offer me this kind of job?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:15:53 BST: It doesn't make me feel bad
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:17:55 BST: they don't have this idea doesn't mean my idea is not good
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:19:03 BST: Right. But they must be thinking something about the idea if they find it ridiculous
>>> 26 September 2017 at 12:19:17 BST: Maybe is also the words you choose and the way you present it
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:20:10 BST: The thing is they don't have any knowledge of finance
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:20:19 BST: I don't think they understand anyway
<<< 26 September 2017 at 12:27:07 BST: The people who interview me seems only seeking for people who can do data collection and cleaning, so what I have told them is beyond what they think and expect, and maybe they don't know how to respond me or give me opinions because they don't know
>>> 26 September 2017 at 13:35:15 BST: I see
>>> 26 September 2017 at 13:35:29 BST: Well. Seems worth reflecting anyway
>>> 26 September 2017 at 13:35:39 BST: I hope we can have time to talk about it soon
>>> 26 September 2017 at 13:35:52 BST: What will you do these days? Going for another trip?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 13:38:37 BST: I am going for a trip in Hefei tomorrow and will be back home directly for the holiday. I am thinking you also will have your last day this Sunday with your family, we can change it to another day?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:15:53 BST: Ok
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:16:04 BST: So you will be in Hefei for almost two weeks
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:16:20 BST: Long time with the family
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:16:30 BST: How are you my love?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:18:17 BST: I will come back earlier, so maybe around next Thursday or so will be back beijing. Maybe will visit luigi in Tianjin. Don't know yet. I am fine. Miss you. If it is not because it is so far, I will go to visit you during the holiday. 😜
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:18:30 BST: How about you? How is there with family?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:20:37 BST: It is nice. They are very nice towards me
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:21:27 BST: Such a long time you havent seen each other.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:21:53 BST: Next time will be at your graduation
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:22:13 BST: Don't know. It is not very important for me
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:22:24 BST: I know
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:22:33 BST: It's a chance for them to go to see you
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:22:35 BST: That's it
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:23:06 BST: Christmas is shortly after. We can skip the graduation and meet at Christmas
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:23:14 BST: Hahaha
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:23:21 BST: If they are willing to
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:23:30 BST: Maybe yes
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:24:50 BST: When are you going to Modena from Genova ? Or you might not
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:25:23 BST: I will spend a day in Milan with my sister
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:25:34 BST: And then will be in Modena from Thursday
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:25:52 BST: What did you want to type to me? And you withdrew?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:26:19 BST: I miss you. I really miss you when I feel sad.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:26:34 BST: You feel sad now?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:26:42 BST: What happened?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:26:50 BST: Thinking of you always give me courage
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:27:12 BST: What happened my dear?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:27:36 BST: Nothing. My usual reflections.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:27:42 BST: I miss you too
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:28:15 BST: I can go to visit you in London 😝
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:29:22 BST: I think I am young and naïve. I foolish myself easily. Emotions have a strong impact on me, especially the good ones. But this blurs my understanding and frustrates me. I still have so much to learn.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:30:09 BST: I hope I bring you good impact though
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:30:34 BST: The emotion these days are strong, ah?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:30:40 BST: With your family
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:31:20 BST: Why it blurs you? And frustrate you?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:31:31 BST: No, my family is nice
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:32:10 BST: I think I fooled myself with PigeonLine. I don't know why I let myself be so involved. That's not my company. It's Cody's
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:32:25 BST: Ah?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:32:28 BST: Why?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:32:34 BST: I guess I was having fun in starting a company and I was naïve
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:33:04 BST: This is not my industry, nor is my idea, and likely not my passion.
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:35:36 BST: Is your Threema not working?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:35:46 BST: I am with my family now
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:36:15 BST: Oh, I thought you want to talk
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:36:24 BST: I don't want to bother you, sorry, I feel stupid now. I should deal with this by myself
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:36:32 BST: No no
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:36:35 BST: Please
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:36:39 BST: Tell me
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:36:45 BST: I am just a bit confused
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:37:10 BST: Why you think it is cody's not you two's
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:38:16 BST: Because it is his idea, his industry, a problem he wants to solve
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:38:48 BST: I am happy to help but I let myself become a pillar of this
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:38:59 BST: so you have this idea that the company is his not because he wants it for himself, but you don't have too much passion?
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:40:01 BST: Yeah, this is not my industry
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:40:19 BST: So what is your Industry?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:40:24 BST: Do you have a clue?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:40:44 BST: I mean you must have come up with some ideas these days to cause this thought
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:41:10 BST: I want to work with money
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:41:17 BST: ?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:41:20 BST: Finance
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:41:24 BST: You mean
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:41:26 BST: I think this is very important for people
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:41:45 BST: Yeah, finance, economy, but using technology
>>> 26 September 2017 at 14:41:56 BST: Those jobs that I found
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:50:44 BST: ？
<<< 26 September 2017 at 15:01:56 BST: But is this a good way to practice. So you want to work for that company which allow you to different banks?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 15:02:08 BST: You can still accept their offer.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 15:02:19 BST: If you really figure out that is what you want to do in the future. But it doesn't mean you shall give up pigeonline. It is a good foundation to learn how to practice technology. And you might get very good results out of it soon.
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:42:11 BST: But is this a good way to practice. So you want to work for that company which allow you to different banks?
<<< 26 September 2017 at 14:42:48 BST: You can still accept their offer.

<<< 26 September 2017 at 17:14:58 BST: Also I want to tell you, no one will always go straight to what they want to do since he beginning. Elon mask was creating the paying system and eventually he sold his company and use all the money the energy system because he realise if there is no energy, there is no economy. I just want to say that maybe you are doing something not in the field you are passionate, but it is definitely useful, and it will help you to go further in the future.

>>> 26 September 2017 at 18:11:12 BST: I don't want to bother or confuse you. I shall make some clarity in myself. This confusions and uncertainty are signs that I need to take some time to understand where and how to walk
>>> 26 September 2017 at 18:11:54 BST: I will take that with calm, to reflect as I always did. It is challenge to understand these feelings and channel them in the right way

>>> 28 September 2017 at 08:58:32 BST: Yeah.. you?
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:00:16 BST: I am fine. Wondering whether you come up with some ideas of your concerns
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:01:10 BST: It's tough, these conflicts. So I am a bit concerned about you
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:09:50 BST: Please, don't be concerned about me
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:10:05 BST: I have my own growth ahead
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:10:21 BST: Well
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:10:33 BST: I know you so spontaneously
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:10:38 BST: *do
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:11:17 BST: It is not a burden. I want to
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:11:29 BST: I shall handle these emotional confusions myself. I more myself than anything else
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:11:34 BST: * Is
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:11:42 BST: Like if I tell you my concerns, you will probably do the same
>>> 28 September 2017 at 09:12:03 BST: Yeah, but I don't want to give you any additional concern
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:12:21 BST: You are not
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:13:07 BST: I like you share your emotions with me. I will close to you
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:13:28 BST: That's a way for me to feel you even when you far away.
<<< 28 September 2017 at 09:14:22 BST: So, it's ok. Don't make a fuss out of this. You already have your confusions, and now don't make other big deal of nothing
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:28:00 BST: Ooooookay boss
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:28:03 BST: :P
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:28:55 BST: I was meeting Giovanni, a good friend from high school. He is studying music
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:29:37 BST: You are in Hefei? How are you? How do you feel few days after your interview?
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:30:28 BST: Sometimes I think you shall come here to realize your dreams. I am afraid it will so though for you in China. I really like the country and the people but it seems the atmosphere there is becoming more and more centralized
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:30:43 BST: Maybe I am wrong ... you know better than me
>>> 28 September 2017 at 11:31:10 BST: Maybe I am just biased
<<< 28 September 2017 at 14:32:07 BST: Will find a job there. My dear. But it is hard for me now. I will try
<<< 28 September 2017 at 14:45:53 BST: Here in china, some people are really not reflective and doesn't have too much ambitious for life. Sometimes this side gives me a hard time. But I also know people who are creative and supportive. I think you are right, the atmosphere which suits me shall be more open and free.
>>> 28 September 2017 at 21:46:35 BST: Those people are here as well. Every kind kind of people is everywhere ... I guess I am talking more about the social and political atmosphere ... I won't recommend you Italy for example. Here could be easier for you than china but still very hard as it's a very regional economy and society. I think UK, US, Canada or norther Europe could suits you more.
>>> 28 September 2017 at 21:47:03 BST: But maybe also very emergent countries..
>>> 28 September 2017 at 21:47:30 BST: I fear the current atmosphere in China is getting more and more complex instead of easing out

<<< 30 September 2017 at 11:55:41 BST: Modena now?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 11:56:27 BST: Ale,hi!, Jacomo, hi
<<< 30 September 2017 at 11:58:40 BST: Hi, Ri
<<< 30 September 2017 at 11:58:52 BST: 😌😌
>>> 30 September 2017 at 11:59:17 BST: My dad is moving into a new house in Modena
>>> 30 September 2017 at 11:59:37 BST: Leaving the house in Genova and move into a bigger house in Modena
>>> 30 September 2017 at 11:59:51 BST: Image (4b2fcb2bd73e5a59.jpg)
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:00:39 BST: This is the house in Modena?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:09:16 BST: The floor seems quite chinese style
>>> 30 September 2017 at 12:20:06 BST: Yes
>>> 30 September 2017 at 12:20:11 BST: Not exactly Chinese
>>> 30 September 2017 at 12:20:23 BST: Image (54138e89d808c16c.jpg)
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:26:22 BST: Seems pretty much alike
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:26:50 BST: The color and flower
>>> 30 September 2017 at 12:44:15 BST: Roses in china?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:45:00 BST: Those are roses?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:45:08 BST: ☺️☺️
>>> 30 September 2017 at 12:47:25 BST: Don't know much about flowers :P
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:51:53 BST: Don't know why cannot send the pics through
<<< 30 September 2017 at 12:53:15 BST: The paint from far because of the color is pretty alike china. But you are right, when you see it from close, it's still quite European like.
>>> 30 September 2017 at 13:40:16 BST: Yeah, true
>>> 30 September 2017 at 13:40:27 BST: You shall see the new house. It's insanely big
>>> 30 September 2017 at 13:40:59 BST: Don't know why cannot send pics. I have no problem. Maybe you ain't activated access to camera and gallery for Threema
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:08:58 BST: Maybe I will have the chance to see it soon. :) it can access my gallery, just the pics can not be loaded. It makes me a bit suspicious about the confidentiality functions. So sometimes when I use what's up, it also have the same problem, cannot send the pics through from china
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:10:13 BST: Interesting ...
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:10:30 BST: Do you think is there some firewall impeding you to do so?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:11:33 BST: I've tried to use different internet spot, even VPN do not help.
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:12:34 BST: I think next time when I will be abroad, I shall try again to test
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:33:42 BST: This is quite weird
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:33:49 BST: Maybe it's just your phone
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:41:48 BST: So how are you? You have came up with some clues of your confusions?
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:41:58 BST: Or you haven't
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:45:19 BST: I have but somewhat differently
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:45:44 BST: I didn't really reached a conclusion over my career early choice
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:46:01 BST: But I want to embrace a different attitude
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:46:54 BST: Early choice? What do you mean? You mean you don't think your earlier choices of your career is good? But you are now having a different attitude towards it
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:47:00 BST: Towards this choices
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:47:22 BST: What is your attitude now?
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:49:54 BST: Yeah. First of all I want to calm down and be less emotional about it. So accept that I am not experienced, knowledgeable or calm enough now to make a choice I will be convinced about.
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:51:00 BST: So I will take some time to reflect. But also I don't want to overly focus or stress myself. I think that also does not help me to be calm. So I will trust myself and let things go a bit. Trying to collect information and reflections and make my moves gradually.
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:51:01 BST: Ok, so you will continue what you have chosen before until you think you can?
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:51:42 BST: Yeah. I am going ahead as planned, trying to learn more about my confusions
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:51:59 BST: Ok, I see
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:52:36 BST: You need to know that what you are doing now will not restrict you to do other things you want in the future
>>> 30 September 2017 at 14:52:51 BST: Sure
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:54:18 BST: And somehow probably can help you in the future.
<<< 30 September 2017 at 14:59:21 BST: Somehow I think your situation is quite different from other people who fall into the field they are not passionate. Your situation are more optimistic in a way that because you are focus on more technical side, so the knowledge can be applied in other field in the future
<<< 30 September 2017 at 15:00:37 BST: But anyway, I am happy you are calming down. Shall enjoy the last two days with your family. Then be more dedicated and reflective to welcome the coming experience.
<<< 30 September 2017 at 15:02:21 BST: One last thing for the topic: the coming experience will need more cautious and consideration to step up and further
>>> 30 September 2017 at 16:36:33 BST: Why do you think so?
<<< 1 October 2017 at 03:00:39 BST: But maybe I am wrong, maybe you need this structure. I think you need to think carefully about it.
<<< 1 October 2017 at 02:32:30 BST: You are building up a startup from almost zero knowledge of python and other skills, and if you want to enter the finance field, you can do the same. Elon musk know almost nothing about finance when he start PayPal, and he also has no experience about rocket before, but start space X
<<< 1 October 2017 at 02:57:56 BST: It's just an example, you are unique, so to do too much comparison is not something I want to tell you. The thing is I see the potential in you that you can be an innovator, then an imitator. I always afraid if you work under a specific frame structure, it will not help you to achieve what you want to achieve.
>>> 1 October 2017 at 09:20:43 BST: I see. That's quite a big compliment and belief about me. I need to see if i am able to back  potential with discipline and mental stability
>>> 1 October 2017 at 09:20:52 BST: But thank you for the trust
<<< 1 October 2017 at 09:34:27 BST: Keep up! We are going to do something for the world.
>>> 1 October 2017 at 13:29:18 BST: Of course !

>>> 13 October 2017 at 14:49:31 BST: Good, I am glad you are learning. I am not surprised that's what they like to talk about. They must need to find someway to make themselves feel good about what they do, which is not easy
<<< 13 October 2017 at 14:52:30 BST: well, basically I think the senior do not do the actual day to day work, but just monitoring. And they are usually not in the office to deal with the company issue. And then when the junior have done all the work, maybe a bit mistakes. The senior complain
<<< 13 October 2017 at 14:53:25 BST: I got to know this because I am not involved in the project team, so when some of the senior talked with each other, they assume I wouldn't feel bad
<<< 13 October 2017 at 14:54:25 BST: This also makes me realise in the future when I need to do something, what i might need to do as a part of the work.
>>> 13 October 2017 at 14:56:51 BST: Interesting. So what value do the senior add you think?
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:00:19 BST: Actually they need to help the junior to solve the problems they met during the project, like taxation, something related to the legislation and so on. And they need to stay in the scene for monitoring and coordinating. But because most of the seniors are "busy". so they don't actually attend
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:15:01 BST: How are they busy?
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:25:15 BST: Well, I guess you already wrote a lot. Perhaps you don't want to talk this more
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:25:59 BST: I get a sense of what you are saying but not really fully as your descriptions are quite high level
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:26:51 BST: We can talk about it on Sunday. I don't want to complain too much. I think this is also a way of learning and I need to learn how to handle the difficult parts of my work
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:27:11 BST: What do you mean by high level?
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:27:21 BST: Complaining is not healthy, you are right. I also don't like it
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:27:36 BST: I know you understand me
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:27:41 BST: You are like this too
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:27:55 BST: And also txt message is not a good way to do it
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:27:56 BST: Also
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:28:04 BST: Haha
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:29:11 BST: You don't like messaging eh
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:31:03 BST: I like messaging you to talk about everything, but not too much about complaining. You don't think so?
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:31:49 BST: Complaint is your choice / responses to what happen to you. You can talk about anything without complaining.
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:32:19 BST: It is hard to explain for me somehow especially it is involved about the culture difference, the job field difference. If we need to talk about my work, it is better we start with talking about those differences
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:32:30 BST: ?
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:33:20 BST: I also agree with your point. But somehow it feels like a complaint
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:33:22 BST: Haha
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:33:42 BST: Maybe I need to adjust my attitude towards my description
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:33:45 BST: It's addictive
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:34:01 BST: What is addictive?
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:34:17 BST: Complaining
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:34:35 BST: Haha, we can find a better way to describe
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:34:41 BST: 😉
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:34:51 BST: It's more about how your react internally
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:35:10 BST: If you don't complain inside yourself it will be straight forward
>>> 13 October 2017 at 15:35:14 BST: At least for me
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:43:25 BST: It is hard to say the seniors haven't done anything but just complaining. First of all, their behaviour of complaining is not something I like. But I also feel as a junior how to reduce this situation to happen in the future. They claimed they are busy? But some of them are writing the book of the poets and busy finding publishers, and some of them are busy finding other projects so that they can make more profits for the future. Blu blu.
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:35:23 BST: The thing is both of us want to know each other's experience and emotions. And neither of us want to complain.
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:35:37 BST: Hahahahaha
<<< 13 October 2017 at 15:39:31 BST: So you mean no matter what we use to describe, it turns out the complaint if we feel the complaint inside of us. Interesting. But I would say my understanding of it. I think everyone has likes and dislikes, preferences somehow. The important thing is how to deal with it. So for example, when I have met something I dislike about my working experience, I turn to remember it in my mind, so I won't do this. And then turns the dislikes into my pushes. And also remind me what I would like to behave when I meet this kind of situations by myself.
<<< 13 October 2017 at 16:22:41 BST: No answer?
<<< 13 October 2017 at 16:22:17 BST: ?
>>> 13 October 2017 at 16:43:10 BST: Would like to answer you properly and not keeping bouncing back from work and phone. But I feel bad you might be asleep by next time I take a break
>>> 13 October 2017 at 17:16:46 BST: Sometimes where I meet some situation that I don't like I ask myself why I don't like, and I build some reflections if this is just a subjective dislike or the is some inter subjective value that I could influence
>>> 13 October 2017 at 17:17:58 BST: From there I usually try to avoid getting stuck with my dislike. If I think is subjective, I usually think is not worth much attention and I ignore it. If I think is intersubjective I try to think the few small things I can do about it
>>> 13 October 2017 at 17:18:55 BST: Perhaps you were in the mood of ignoring this but I pushed you to talk about it because I am keen to know what you do, but I feel somehow it was also strolling around in your thoughts and feelings
>>> 13 October 2017 at 17:20:39 BST: Sorry if my replies arrive that your already sleeping. If so, safe dreams, sweetheart.
<<< 14 October 2017 at 02:05:10 BST: It's really not because I want to ignore my feeling or don't like texting to you. I like to talk to you when you feel free to talk and when you have time to reflect with me. So understand me. With my love, sweetheart
<<< 14 October 2017 at 02:03:30 BST: I was sleeping without my phone next to me. So just saw your messages. I know you want to know my situation just like how much I want to know yours. I am very glad we are like this. The point this, as you said you are working, and you need to txt me when you were struggling between work and txt. I prefer you to focus on your work. I am quite sensitive that when I see you reply me late or just reply a bit, I get a message you are busy. Then I stop texting too much, because I thought there is a better timing. Not because I ignore my feeling. I feel if I care about my feeling, I also want to express it in a better timing, so I get your responses, and not just me throwing bunch of messages.
<<< 14 October 2017 at 16:42:28 BST: 😶😐😑😯😦😧😮😲😵
<<< 14 October 2017 at 16:44:17 BST: busy boy today, ha?😝
<<< 14 October 2017 at 16:46:51 BST: Going to sleep, enjoy your day, kisses for my annoyed boyfriend
<<< 14 October 2017 at 16:54:53 BST: I love you, don't want you to feel bad! Kisses.
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:04:22 BST: Was that your moods throughout the day because of me not replying?
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:04:40 BST: I am sorry
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:04:57 BST: Have been coding since I woke up
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:05:12 BST: I read your message when I just woke up
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:05:41 BST: I am sorry you felt throwing a bunch of messages and getting short replies
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:06:25 BST: I do enjoy reading from you, even when I am working and go back and forth from that but I can see that is annoying for you
<<< 14 October 2017 at 17:08:01 BST: Love you! I know you are busy! Just want to know you understand my feelings not misunderstanding
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:08:10 BST: I guess it is also the type of work I do. When I am into it I am somehow disconnected from the rest of the world
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:08:37 BST: It is a bit alienating
<<< 14 October 2017 at 17:08:46 BST: This is quite ok for me! I mean this way of working. I don't mind
<<< 14 October 2017 at 17:09:38 BST: Going to sleep babe. Cannot wait to talk to you tomorrow.
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:11:28 BST: Okay :)
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:11:40 BST: Goodnight !
>>> 14 October 2017 at 17:12:06 BST: "See" you soon :D
>>> 15 October 2017 at 10:42:50 BST: Hey
>>> 15 October 2017 at 10:42:59 BST: What are you up to?
<<< 15 October 2017 at 11:06:40 BST: I just finished dinner. Head back home now. Maybe we can have our call around in half an hour if you have the time then
>>> 15 October 2017 at 11:13:30 BST: Ok

>>> 15 October 2017 at 18:34:03 BST: Almost you ... 💛
>>> 15 October 2017 at 20:00:14 BST: Oh ... during tonight call my brother asked me if you are visiting us in Modena at Christmas. I asked 'so you want her to come?' he said 'yes'. Not to persuade to come. If you don't have enough holidays, you shouldn't stress too much about coming. But it's important to me to let you know this little exchange we had.
<<< 16 October 2017 at 05:23:35 BST: Image (a02d25b3d490db41.jpg)
<<< 16 October 2017 at 02:54:01 BST: ☺️that's very nice of him. I will get to know more about my holiday later on. Then I will tell you. Love you! And the pillow seems nice too with the flowers and yellow color. 😄

<<< 20 October 2017 at 12:10:44 BST: Meat consumption? By reducing the production? I don't think it is very likely if people in china do not aware how serious they wasted meat.
<<< 20 October 2017 at 12:10:47 BST: :(
<<< 20 October 2017 at 12:11:18 BST: But I see they are finally trying to do something about the meat consumption.
<<< 20 October 2017 at 12:11:24 BST: :)
>>> 20 October 2017 at 13:59:15 BST: :)
>>> 20 October 2017 at 13:59:24 BST: Mood swings?

>>> 24 October 2017 at 09:44:44 BST: At the British library
<<< 24 October 2017 at 09:44:47 BST: Researcher in which field?
>>> 24 October 2017 at 09:44:50 BST: Then I will go to the office
>>> 24 October 2017 at 09:45:03 BST: Artificial Intelligence
<<< 24 October 2017 at 09:45:01 BST: Library must be very nice
<<< 24 October 2017 at 09:45:12 BST: For pigeonline?
>>> 24 October 2017 at 09:45:21 BST: Nope, for Satalia
<<< 24 October 2017 at 09:45:27 BST: I see
<<< 24 October 2017 at 09:45:58 BST: This person is a freelancer?
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:01:33 BST: Nope. He is a researcher at the Alan Turing Institute
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:02:01 BST: Great meeting. This guy is so passionate about is research. So caring about the results.
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:03:06 BST: alan turing

>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:03:45 BST: This is Kings Cross station
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:04:15 BST: I see
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:05:07 BST: Very happy to hear the conversation has been great!
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:08:56 BST: :)
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:28:02 BST: You? Your work?
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:30:16 BST: I had a busy day. The project has passed the voting inside of the company. Within the meeting, I learned a lot from the senior lawyer and accountant. They delivered many questions and answers. Good experiences too.
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:31:14 BST: Now I am at home, studying CFA. Feeling devoted and happy for my day.
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:32:45 BST: I also made a small written mistakes for the report, I need to improve this part of me.
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:33:42 BST: So what you have talked about with this guy? You have a project cooperating with him?
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:38:45 BST: We talk about how to verify that AI systems behave properly
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:38:53 BST: He leads a research group about it
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:39:15 BST: We are interested to know more and perhaps turn it into some industrial application
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:41:52 BST: The one you are developing- I mean the AI system? That will be great. To apply it seems a leap of the research. He is positive about the result? Do you think you guys will cooperate?
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:45:18 BST: Too early to say
>>> 24 October 2017 at 12:45:31 BST: We will continue talking and getting to know each other work
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:46:50 BST: Well, you get some different opinions today from another expert. It's already a great experience l.
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:48:05 BST: But it seems he has a team, you are working kind of by yourself
<<< 24 October 2017 at 12:51:10 BST: It will be quite helpful to exchange with them.
>>> 24 October 2017 at 13:13:23 BST: Let's see :) very very explorative talk this was
>>> 26 October 2017 at 08:37:01 BST: http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/25/china-refuses-to-admit-it-has-a-rape-problem-i-would-know/
<<< 26 October 2017 at 09:33:11 BST: Cannot open the website. What is it about?  Rape problem in china?
<<< 26 October 2017 at 10:00:34 BST: The manis name is Wengui Guo
<<< 26 October 2017 at 09:57:52 BST: i can see the news now. I am aware that china has a massive media control. And somehow block any website abroad broadcasting something against china. And nowadays force VPN off-service. It's quite bad in this way. I mean we have the right to know what has happened. But also I want to say that even the news do not appear this kind of bad, we( I mean many people) get to know what has happened. Recently there is Chinese business man reports one central government officer ( very important one, name Wang Qishan) organised a jet crashing. It's quite serious what this man has told to the western media what many officers have done in china. The news has been blocked, but somehow I heard a lot of people has been discussing this.
<<< 26 October 2017 at 09:58:27 BST: If you have time maybe you have all access to this news
>>> 26 October 2017 at 12:59:53 BST: Interesting points but not very clear to me the whole flow of your message
>>> 26 October 2017 at 13:00:05 BST: What do you think of the topic about rape?
>>> 26 October 2017 at 13:00:18 BST: And what about this jet incident? Who died?
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:01:06 BST: What do you think of this rape issue?
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:01:13 BST: In china
>>> 26 October 2017 at 13:09:48 BST: I was under the impression that China is very safe
>>> 26 October 2017 at 13:10:02 BST: But this article says is a fake impression made by the government
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:10:29 BST: From what I have seen, not from the  main stream medias, but some small media report, these kind of rape news
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:11:25 BST: Also even when I was doing my bachelor degree, there are also this kind of stories talking among students.
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:15:48 BST: So I want to say that from my first message which you don't really understand, that we have access of bad news even government trying to repress those
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:16:19 BST: There are a lot of want to say about this repressions in china.
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:21:27 BST: So I mentioned about recently happened events related to formal government officer Qishan Wang.
<<< 26 October 2017 at 13:23:55 BST: But in another point of view, the repression cannot really block the access. Many young people understand many facts like raping, corruption and other politic conflicts
>>> 26 October 2017 at 16:41:21 BST: I see
>>> 26 October 2017 at 16:41:55 BST: So you think China is safer than other countries in respect of rape or not? Or is just a believe we get from main stream media?
<<< 27 October 2017 at 04:59:03 BST: About the topic of "safer than" other countries, mmmm, I would use " more repressive than other countries". Because of the repression, many dangerous issues are not appeared that horrifying. But I think there are out there in china as far as I know
<<< 27 October 2017 at 04:56:21 BST: I think china is definitely trying to make an image of safety. But somehow I know and many others know there are serious issues as well is happening. It's not deniable no matter how mainstream media is broadcasting
>>> 27 October 2017 at 06:48:23 BST: This is a very interesting insight. I think I personally was a bit influenced by the main stream media. Thank you for sharing with honestly and reflection
>>> 27 October 2017 at 06:48:26 BST: Hi
>>> 27 October 2017 at 06:48:31 BST: Good morning :)
<<< 27 October 2017 at 08:10:05 BST: Morning there! Taking train back to Beijing here.

>>> 27 October 2017 at 10:48:18 BST: As far I as understood I am just a fresh graduate keen to learn more
>>> 27 October 2017 at 10:48:31 BST: But thanks for believing in me
>>> 27 October 2017 at 10:48:43 BST: You are also fantastic :)
>>> 27 October 2017 at 10:49:18 BST: Very stable mind. Rare to find
<<< 27 October 2017 at 10:49:35 BST: Hahahahaha, someone is quite modest

<<< 27 October 2017 at 12:54:33 BST: okey
<<< 27 October 2017 at 12:54:41 BST: ☺️
<<< 29 October 2017 at 07:53:50 GMT: Morning there. You are probably doing your weekly reflection and the plan for next week now. Can we have our call at 10 pm Beijing time, so 3pm London time? I know you usually have your gym at that time. So let me know whether it works for you! Kisses
<<< 29 October 2017 at 09:03:55 GMT: I think we can Skype earlier. I did what I have done, just need to teach Joanne for a while. So maybe you don't need to change your schedule for gym. I think it will be more convenient for both of us. I am free after 7pm here.
>>> 29 October 2017 at 12:46:14 GMT: Hey there
<<< 29 October 2017 at 12:46:44 GMT: Hey hey
>>> 29 October 2017 at 12:47:00 GMT: Available?

>>> 29 October 2017 at 12:47:11 GMT: Ok ;)
>>> 29 October 2017 at 22:22:04 GMT: I am sorry about the way our call ended today ... I get very involved with my own struggles and problems and a bit ignoring of the concerns of those around me, which is a bit selfish and childish. Sorry about that. As you said there are still many immature sides of me, for many years I was lulled and protected from time, money and independence issues :)
>>> 29 October 2017 at 22:23:21 GMT: And sorry for wasting the rare precious time we have together once a week. I shall cut shorter my moody morning and started talking with you earlier.
>>> 29 October 2017 at 22:24:18 GMT: Hope you'll have a good wake up 🌞 and put my snoopiness behind
<<< 30 October 2017 at 01:57:56 GMT: Well, you are improving a lot with your mood swings already. Before we can not really talk through so many like what we did last night. I think you know this part of you quite well, just don't have a better way to control it. As for me, I get to know this part of you long time ago.  And I see your afford of improving. Hope you feel better with your struggles, my love
>>> 30 October 2017 at 08:25:09 GMT: Thanks, I feel a bit better. Hopefully imperfect periods have their usefulness as well..

<<< 30 October 2017 at 14:38:24 GMT: maybe he just wants you to get out from this bed. 😝

<<< 30 October 2017 at 15:14:04 GMT: 😊 morning Chen's collection, not always sexy.
>>> 30 October 2017 at 15:15:21 GMT: What were you reading on your phone with that smile? And where were you?
<<< 30 October 2017 at 15:30:36 GMT: I was reading your messages😉
<<< 30 October 2017 at 15:31:21 GMT: And I was at Joanne's campus, studying with her the whole day there.
<<< 30 October 2017 at 15:31:23 GMT: Why?
>>> 30 October 2017 at 15:31:39 GMT: It looked like a campus
>>> 30 October 2017 at 15:32:02 GMT: BLCU?

>>> 31 October 2017 at 10:32:00 GMT: Why is this guys running away? What has he done?
<<< 31 October 2017 at 10:34:51 GMT: File d150717d6a77577d-Happy Birthday!.pdf
<<< 31 October 2017 at 10:35:23 GMT: File 1af535ef4e118294-Happy Birthday!.pdf
<<< 31 October 2017 at 10:36:55 GMT: You can read the article when you have time. It is just a small part of what our government trying to hide.
>>> 31 October 2017 at 11:35:37 GMT: Okay :)
>>> 31 October 2017 at 11:40:02 GMT: How do we know the guys is good? Seems he is chasing his own interests
<<< 31 October 2017 at 11:43:09 GMT: Not sure he is "good" or not lying. But He used to work with china special intelligence and security office before. And why you think he was being chasing by our government if he don't know anything? There should be something. But not sure how much.
>>> 31 October 2017 at 12:03:56 GMT: I see. I just think perpahs this is internal politics and shit inside the government
>>> 31 October 2017 at 12:04:19 GMT: Every country has this. The USA is behaving in the exact same way with Edward Snowden
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:40:09 GMT: Yes, I know snowden, when to Russia instead. But if it is true, it means the chief anti corruption officer himself is corrupting. Will be a really big joke.
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:40:36 GMT: And not too many people knows about this in china. Every news have been blocked
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:42:42 GMT: I see
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:43:02 GMT: But I am quite confident the chief anti corruption officer is corrupted
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:43:11 GMT: Hahahahaha
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:43:18 GMT: 😂😂😂
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:43:37 GMT: As most of western people doing business in China know and say openly that *every* government official is corrupted
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:43:48 GMT: Well, not as how they pictured it in china
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:43:53 GMT: And they say explicitly _every single one_
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:45:10 GMT: What about this corruption thing in western world?
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:45:19 GMT: Better? Same?
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:46:52 GMT: I'd say a bit better because if a politician is found corrupt he or she cannot run for elections
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:47:00 GMT: Because of public pressure
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:47:16 GMT: But there is media manipulation so in the end is also tricky
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:47:36 GMT: But for instance for private companies nowadays is almost impossible to corrupt public officers
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:47:59 GMT: I mean .. in America they have lobbies and they found their ways
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:48:15 GMT: Such as donations to the politicians non profit foundations
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:48:29 GMT: Or paying them for special guest speeches
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:48:39 GMT: They found a public way
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:48:48 GMT: But usually this happen with presidents
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:48:57 GMT: Corrupting low level public officers is much harder
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:49:05 GMT: Trump himself is a business man
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:51:44 GMT: From what I heard that doing business is not that "flexible" abroad. It also means between the low level procedure it is hard to.
<<< 31 October 2017 at 14:52:24 GMT: But in china maybe the lower it gets, the flexibility it gets
>>> 31 October 2017 at 14:59:07 GMT: Yeah, that sounds about right from what I heard around
>>> 1 November 2017 at 08:57:46 GMT: Good morning sweet Chen
<<< 1 November 2017 at 09:02:13 GMT: Morning love

>>> 1 November 2017 at 09:59:28 GMT: Direct flight from Rome
<<< 1 November 2017 at 10:01:52 GMT: Well, it is a bit short, but I guess, if it is the best offer, you shall also consider. I would prefer a bit longer. But you can make the decision, I will support your decision
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:19:00 GMT: Image (0ba6c0c1ebaf39d2.jpg)
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:32:12 GMT: Check out the dates. I actually went for the flight from Jan 1 to Jan 11, which was about the same offer
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:32:23 GMT: 😘
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:32:42 GMT: Around the 400£ I anticipated I could spend, now only the visa is left.
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:35:37 GMT: Your photo motivated me 😂

<<< 1 November 2017 at 10:48:25 GMT: I can anticipate the visa cost.
<<< 1 November 2017 at 10:49:27 GMT: And that is a very good price for return tickets! But you also need the flight back to the UK, right?
>>> 1 November 2017 at 10:56:51 GMT: Yes. I would have to buy that anyway to come back home for Christmas
<<< 1 November 2017 at 11:18:03 GMT: i see. Let me know what I can do for your visa run. Kisses

They belong to different industries, so get to know different processes. and also relate to the features of the company, the IPO plan need to be fit in as well. So quite good. But the company it itself is not that exciting, no innovation involved. I am a bit doubtful of their future growth.
<<< 8 November 2017 at 07:58:43 GMT: How inspiring there in Lisburn?
>>> 9 November 2017 at 06:44:19 GMT: Ahah. I guess sometimes we received similar assessment from some senior people

>>> 9 November 2017 at 11:34:15 GMT: Oh we have been pitching PigeonLine to sooo many people
>>> 9 November 2017 at 11:34:28 GMT: Some of them said we don't really have a plan to scale
>>> 9 November 2017 at 11:34:38 GMT: Like we can be a good business but not a big business
<<< 9 November 2017 at 11:47:48 GMT: Quite an achievement I would say let many people to know pigeonline. so what do you think about this kind of comment?

>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:01:23 GMT: Hello my love
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:01:41 GMT: Seasons keep passing
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:02:14 GMT: And I got to see how we juggle around in an ocean of people where each of us wants something different
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:02:48 GMT: Yet, we get to think about this ocean and the way it ought to be, the right directions for us to go as a society
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:03:48 GMT: By I am growing in the idea that this body will be moved only by the countless interactions between the goal-oriented actions of each and every of us
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:05:33 GMT: Yet - some of us have the goal of helping others, like me and you. Which I cannot really understand, because some of those that we are willing to help, won't give a shit about this and keep seeking their own goal, which is perfectly rational
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:07:38 GMT: Still, those who cares cannot stop care that easily. It is almost unconditional love. A trap, a duty or a virtue? Who knows, perhaps neither of this, perhaps is just the randomness of nature that assigns specific attitudes and behavior in different people and there here it goes, let's dance with the random and what results as the next stage of our journeys is totally a chance
>>> 16 November 2017 at 09:09:35 GMT: I guess we cannot answer this questions ... What can I say, so far has been enjoyable to ponder a bit about them, I guess this is enough. A part of this enjoyment was due to you. Thank you my love.
<<< 16 November 2017 at 09:36:36 GMT: Hey, love. What an thoughtful morning. I like when you send me these messages thinking deeply. No matter what you have experienced, would give you a lot of sources to reflect. That's a very very special trait which I appreciate a lot.
<<< 16 November 2017 at 09:38:42 GMT: Indeed we live and wonder in these crowd where everyone has different ideas for life. What we can do is to follow our ideas, while using our energy and love to spread out to some others who also think similar.
<<< 16 November 2017 at 09:42:26 GMT: There are too many uncertainties about other people. I know you would say we cannot control our own paths as an separate individual. But I would rather be focus on what we want and what we can do on this path. There could be a chance for us to see something beautiful on the path or not, but we cannot stop along with our reflections and actions. My dear, I am here with you.
<<< 16 November 2017 at 09:43:31 GMT: It's also a tremendous experience so far with you on the way. I enjoy it a lot. You are also my inspiration and motivation when I am tried and have doubts.
>>> 16 November 2017 at 11:39:03 GMT: > EXDSSRMP: Indeed we live and wonder in these crowd where everyone has different ideas for life. What we can do is to follow our ideas, while using our energy and love to spread out to some others who also think similar. Why sticking with those that think similar? I mean, I see the value of people that purse different things. They do it because their paths was different from mine
>>> 16 November 2017 at 11:39:52 GMT: And over time we developed different sensibilities, but this does not make what I pursue more important than what they pursue
<<< 16 November 2017 at 11:40:30 GMT: i mean some others who are seeking for our love and energy
<<< 16 November 2017 at 11:40:53 GMT: Don't perceive it wrongly
<<< 16 November 2017 at 11:42:04 GMT: Of course people can think differently, I value differences. But if some people don't want what we give out, it is not that helpful if we insist and be upset of being refused
>>> 16 November 2017 at 14:21:12 GMT: I see, yes we are looking at it from different perspectives
>>> 17 November 2017 at 08:36:09 GMT: Image (101f306015dc515f.jpg)
>>> 17 November 2017 at 08:36:19 GMT: Chilly and sunny
>>> 17 November 2017 at 08:36:23 GMT: A beautiful day
>>> 17 November 2017 at 08:36:54 GMT: I am meeting my family in Paris this weekend. May not have the usual time for our Sunday call 🙁
<<< 17 November 2017 at 09:15:44 GMT: Seems very calm and exhilarating. You shall enjoy weekend with your family! We can find other time to have the call.

>>> 17 November 2017 at 15:21:57 GMT: It could be anywhere. In the dark places are all the same
<<< 17 November 2017 at 15:24:34 GMT: 🙃
<<< 18 November 2017 at 00:44:44 GMT: morning here in beijing. Here too, very clear sky and chilly air. On my way to have class. Say "happy birthday!" For me to your little brother. :)

>>> 18 November 2017 at 08:35:17 GMT: Hope to find the same wether when I come visit
>>> 18 November 2017 at 08:35:22 GMT: How is your studying going?
>>> 18 November 2017 at 08:35:33 GMT: I am studying some more financial data these days
<<< 18 November 2017 at 10:53:30 GMT: Same here, hope there will be nice weather like today when you arrive. Studying was intense today, just finished the lecture.
<<< 18 November 2017 at 10:56:04 GMT: I suppose you are on your way to meet your family? I am on my way to the theatre. Nannan gets a free ticket for me to watch the play- the letter from an unknown woman
<<< 18 November 2017 at 10:56:46 GMT: How do you find about studying financial data?
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:54:38 GMT: Image (2d01689760ac03ed.jpg)
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:54:49 GMT: A bit tired here
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:55:14 GMT: U'r probably already asleep
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:56:55 GMT: I need to learn about financial fraud detection for my job and I was also starting some work on crypto currencies price analysis
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:57:45 GMT: Financial data is difficult. A lot of noise and very many time stamp points
>>> 18 November 2017 at 17:58:10 GMT: What do you think 💭?
<<< 19 November 2017 at 01:39:23 GMT: BTW, your tired face is quite cute. ;)
<<< 19 November 2017 at 01:39:03 GMT: Oh, definitely there are a lot of tricks people can do to manipulate the financial statements. To learn a bit fraud detection is useful. It is not easy for the people who have never learned it before. There are a lot of means and ways to change the financial statements by just changing a little bit of the elements inside. I still have many thing to get to know in here.
>>> 19 November 2017 at 09:22:42 GMT: The approach we may adopt is different. I think we are asked to automate fraud detection
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:26:31 GMT: 🤓that will be great if you can make it automatic
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:27:06 GMT: But quite difficult to automate
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:27:09 GMT: I think
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:27:58 GMT: I will be soooo excited to see the automation financial fraud system get developed!
>>> 19 November 2017 at 09:37:59 GMT: I think there are already a lot of tools for consumer financial fraud detection
>>> 19 November 2017 at 09:38:10 GMT: When is an individual trying to fraud a financial instruction
>>> 19 November 2017 at 09:38:20 GMT: That's what we will be working on
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:38:30 GMT: But why at work we don't use it
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:38:41 GMT: 🤔
<<< 19 November 2017 at 09:39:05 GMT: But anyway I am excited about your new project
>>> 19 November 2017 at 10:32:33 GMT: Good question. Maybe they are vastly available to me because I know about them in the field
>>> 19 November 2017 at 10:32:57 GMT: But perhaps people don't know about them in your company I guess
>>> 19 November 2017 at 10:33:12 GMT: Let's see if and how the project starts. I am excited too

<<< 25 November 2017 at 12:47:02 GMT: Why
<<< 25 November 2017 at 12:47:08 GMT: Hahah
<<< 25 November 2017 at 12:47:10 GMT: A bit
<<< 25 November 2017 at 12:55:03 GMT: What makes me think when I saw the news, is that why when we discuss about changing people into mechanized is imaginable, but this is weird. I mean in order to replace our organs, even head in the future, maybe this kind of surgery is inevitable
>>> 25 November 2017 at 13:58:37 GMT: I see
>>> 25 November 2017 at 13:58:55 GMT: I neve though before you could replace a head
>>> 25 November 2017 at 13:59:11 GMT: But hey, China is taking us into the future
>>> 25 November 2017 at 13:59:37 GMT: But I suspect we are still very far from doing this on a living being
>>> 25 November 2017 at 13:59:50 GMT: How long could they survive without head ?!?!
<<< 25 November 2017 at 15:36:50 GMT: That's something yet not conquering. I guess, something is yet not discovering but about to. If we can replace everything with technology, who knows what will happen. ;)
>>> 25 November 2017 at 18:07:22 GMT: Very far away still , but who knows
>>> 25 November 2017 at 18:09:00 GMT: Just had a bit of a painful conversation with Cody about PigeonLine. We were thinking who will go full time and I said I don't foresee that in the near future and then we talked about what I'll do when contracts end with Satalia and I not sure they I will confirm my current commitment
>>> 25 November 2017 at 18:09:38 GMT: You are already asleep probably but I am lucky I can share this
>>> 25 November 2017 at 18:10:04 GMT: I would have had this conversation later, but hey, it happened
>>> 25 November 2017 at 18:10:11 GMT: I am not really happy it happened
